            <title><![CDATA[Movie Making with Minecraft PE in the Classroom]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Movie Making with Minecraft PE in the Classroom</h1><p>Making movies is a great way for my EFL students to practice their writing and speaking. However, as the students reach the upper elementary and middle school grades they shy away from showing their faces on screen. To remedy this problem I started using Minecraft PE (MCPE) instead of live action movies. All of my students, no matter their age, love Minecraft. So when I asked them if they wanted to make a movie using MCPE they were pretty excited.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/807e8a5a05a35cd27d85d261983e458fa3e95df7.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Asia and Bloxels </h1><p>One of Asia's favorite games is Adventure Time Game Wizard. The part of the game she liked best was creating her own levels. However, as much as she loved the game something was missing. This year Pixel Press released a brand new app called Bloxels. I guess the developers heard Asia's wish because now she can create her own character and much more! </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/cae72f1226de10d1e965752fdf63f35f7743d8da.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Adventure Time Game Wizard </h1><p>Few games other than Minecraft have sparked my interest for classroom use in recent months. The games that have, are riddled with in-app-purchases and advertisements. However, Pixel Press recently released Adventure Time: Game Wizard for the iOS and Android.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/cdf9cbe40ee6bea86e786c4247dfdc6c4a7daf33.png"></article>]]></description>
