One of Asia's favorite games is Adventure Time Game Wizard. The part of the game she liked best was creating her own levels. However, as much as she loved the game something was missing. This year Pixel Press released a brand new app called Bloxels. I guess the developers heard Asia's wish because now she can create her own character and much more! ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/cae72f1226de10d1e965752fdf63f35f7743d8da.jpg)

An exciting part of Bloxels is the 13bit Builders. 13bit Builders are a special groups of children who are dedicated to showcasing their building talents with Bloxels. Asia was very excited to learn that she was selected to be a part of this special group.
