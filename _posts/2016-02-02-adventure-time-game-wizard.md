Few games other than Minecraft have sparked my interest for classroom use in recent months. The games that have, are riddled with in-app-purchases and advertisements. However, Pixel Press recently released Adventure Time: Game Wizard for the iOS and Android.

What makes this game special is the option to create your own adventure. What makes this gave even more special is the ability to do that within the app or on a piece of paper. (More about this later)

I love using the iPad as a tool for digital story telling. There are so many great apps that combine to engage students in the wonderful world of storytelling. Moreover, these stories can easily be shared or written collaboratively with classrooms from around the world.

Game Wizard is a new and interesting way for students to collaborate on a story through a platform game. The game is based on familiar characters from the Cartoon Network. The game is divided into three sections: Play, Create, Arcade.

**Play**

Game Wizard is a simple but entertaining platform game. There are 5 characters to unlock (More to come later), each with it's own special abilities and movements. The object of the game is to work your way through the different worlds collecting coins, unlocking characters and defeating bosses. To reach the end you will need to use each of the characters' special abilities and movements at the right time.

**Create**

This is where the app stands above the rest! As I mentioned earlier, there are two ways to create your own game. The first way is to use the in app builder. You begin by selecting a sheet which you use to create your game. The sheets come in 4 different sizes. You can add a numerous amount of sheets to build on to your game! In the build mode you have many options to add platforms, hazards, enemies, and special blocks for your game. The interface is simple to use and a lot of fun. Some of the items are locked when you first begin, however, these can easily be unlocked with gold from playing the game. (No IAPs)

Once you've finished creating your game, you can chose from 4 unique design layouts. The layouts really bring your game to life. This is where you add your enemies as well. There is a limit to the amount of enemies you can add to each sheet but it doesn't take away from the game at all. You can add more sheets to extend your game or you can keep the game to one sheet or level. When you add new sheets your end points become check points which allows you to move more freely between levels.

**Draw**

The best way to create your own level is to draw it by hand. The game supplies special paper that you can print to create your levels. On the sides of the paper there are special symbols which represent the unique blocks in the game. Once you've drawn your game, all you need to do is scan the paper with your iPad and it becomes a new sheet in your game. I would recommend using a ruler because the scanning process isn't perfect. Some blocks my not turn out as you expected. However, you can easily fix this from within the game editor.

**Arcade**

The arcade is filled with games created by people from all over the world. This is a great place to share your own created game or find ideas for a new game that you would like to create.

**In the Classroom**

This game has a lot of potential for classroom use. As I mentioned above I love to engage students with digital story telling tools. For this game I have a few ideas I would like to try in the near future with my classes.

1\. My first idea would be to have students create a story based on the characters from the game. They can write the story in their notebooks or create the story in the Book Creator App. Once their stories are completed students would work together to design the levels based on their stories. This would be a great way for students to combine their stories and games in to one. In the end, we would screencast our iPads and students would give a virtual tour of them game, explaining how it connects to their story.

2\. Another idea would be for students to create levels and share them with students abroad. Students from other countries would share their levels (Through drawings or the Arcade). Finally, students would create stories from their levels that were share with them.

As you can see, the app has a lot of potential. I am hoping for more characters and level designs to get added in the future. Also, it would be fantastic if they added the Boss characters to the level design, as well as, the ability for children to create their own characters.
